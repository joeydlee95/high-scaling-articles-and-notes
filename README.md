# Scaling and System Design

The primary goal of this repository is to maintain a gathering of information and knowledge from various sources on scaling and system designing as a personal record book to show my progress over time. It is my personal goal to be able to build systems and full stack softwares that are able to scale and be able to share this with people who are also interested.
